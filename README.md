The Phone Book:
Welcome! This is a RUBY application that uses two classes.
The Contact class will store the name & email.
The Phone class, relying upon the Contact class, can store multiple phone numbers, as well as the optional information of what type of line (home/work/cell) the number is.

Installation:
To run the primary application you will need both:
-the sinatra gem
-the sinatra-contrib gem
  Though, you could use the enclosed gemfile to grab these by simply running:
  -the bundler gem, using the "bundle" command
Further, if you want to use the specs (included), you will need:
-the rspec gem

Sinatra will allow you to view the website at: localhost:4567/

Enter your contacts, with each one's email and phone number.
As soon as you submit, you should see that contact's name in the list below.
Each name links to a separate page where you can add more information.
